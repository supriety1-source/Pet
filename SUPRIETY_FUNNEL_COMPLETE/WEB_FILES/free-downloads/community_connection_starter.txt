1. FINDING SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITIES
────────────────────────────
• Mutual aid meetings: Search https://findtreatment.gov/ for local peer support and filter by “support groups.”
• Online recovery spaces:
  - Reddit r/StopSpeeding, r/OpiatesRecovery (moderated peer communities)
  - https://www.smartrecovery.org/community/ (SMART Recovery online meetings)
  - https://www.facesandvoicesofrecovery.org/resources/recovery-community-organizations/ (directory of recovery community organizations)
• Faith or values-based groups: Ask local shelters, community centers, or libraries for weekly gatherings that align with your values.

2. CONVERSATION STARTERS FOR PEER SUPPORT
────────────────────────────
• “What helped you stay grounded this week?”
• “Can we swap strategies for handling cravings or stress?”
• “I’m focusing on boundaries—what does a healthy boundary look like for you?”
• “What’s one resource you’re grateful for right now?”
• Gemini prompt: “Create five empathetic conversation starters to deepen connection with a new recovery partner.”

3. BOUNDARY SETTING IN RECOVERY RELATIONSHIPS
────────────────────────────
• Define your non-negotiables. Example categories: sobriety, communication style, respect.
• Communicate clearly:
  - State the boundary (“I can’t be around active use.”)
  - Explain the why (“It pulls me back into survival mode.”)
  - Offer an alternative (“Let’s meet for coffee after your meeting.”)
• Boundary reset script: “I value our connection, and I need to protect my recovery. Let’s create a plan that keeps both of us safe.”
• Gemini prompt: “Draft a boundary-setting text that protects my recovery without shaming the other person.”

4. BUILDING ACCOUNTABILITY PARTNERSHIPS
────────────────────────────
• Choose partners who:
  - Show up consistently.
  - Respect confidentiality.
  - Celebrate progress, not perfection.
• Weekly check-in structure:
  1. Share one win.
  2. Share one challenge.
  3. State a focus for next week.
  4. Schedule your next check-in.
• Accountability tracker idea: share a Google Sheet or note with columns for commitments, check-in dates, and mood scores.
• Gemini prompt: “Design a 10-minute weekly accountability agenda for two recovery partners.”
