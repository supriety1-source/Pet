Daily practices Joey Noble used to rebuild hope from the ground up.
Educational motivation only – customize with your coach or counselor.

────────────────────────────
1. MORNING LIGHTING RITUAL (5 MINUTES)
────────────────────────────
• Step outside or by a window within 30 minutes of waking.
• Take five deep breaths: inhale for 4, hold for 2, exhale for 6.
• Whisper the mantra: “I’m the proof that the struggle was worth the solution.”
• Gemini prompt to amplify: “Gemini, give me three energizing affirmations for today’s priorities.”

────────────────────────────
2. MICRO-WIN MOMENTUM BOARD
────────────────────────────
• Divide a notebook page into three columns: Body, Mind, Connection.
• Each column gets one micro-win per day (e.g., “walked 10 minutes,” “read one page,” “texted a supporter”).
• Celebrate completion by circling the wins in mint or teal for visual reinforcement.
• Gemini prompt: “Help me celebrate three micro-wins from today in a short gratitude journal entry.”

────────────────────────────
3. FIVE-POINT REFRAME FOR HARD DAYS
────────────────────────────
1. Name the emotion (“I feel anxious/angry/numb”).
2. Identify the trigger (“It hit after the phone call / headline / memory”).
3. Claim the lesson (“This feeling is showing me I need ______”).
4. Choose a counter-action (“I’ll walk to the corner, call my sponsor, or re-read page 12”).
5. Future-cast (“Tonight I’ll check in with someone and report how I used this moment”).
• Gemini prompt: “Act as a peer coach and help me reframe this challenge: [describe situation].”

────────────────────────────
4. PURPOSE-DRIVEN EVENING CHECK-IN
────────────────────────────
• Ask yourself three questions nightly:
  - What gave me life today?
  - Where did I show courage?
  - Who can I appreciate before bed?
• Send one gratitude message before midnight (text, DM, or journal letter).
• Gemini prompt: “Draft a 3-sentence gratitude message for [name] acknowledging how they supported my recovery.”

────────────────────────────
5. SUNDAY RESET HUDDLE (SELF OR GROUP)
────────────────────────────
• Review last week’s micro-win board.
• Choose one area (Body, Mind, Connection) to stretch by 5%.
• Set a “non-negotiable” for the coming week (e.g., “attend Tuesday meeting,” “complete worksheet”).
• Share your non-negotiable with an accountability partner.
• Gemini prompt: “Design a one-page Sunday planning template that keeps my focus on Body, Mind, Connection goals.”

Remember: These practices supplement professional care. Bring them to therapy, coaching, or peer groups to personalize your path.
