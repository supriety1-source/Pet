1. BREATHING & GROUNDING SEQUENCES
────────────────────────────
• 4-6 Breathing: inhale through the nose for 4, exhale for 6, repeat for 3 minutes.
• Box breathing: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4 – visualize a calming teal square.
• 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: name five things you see, four you can touch, three you hear, two you smell, one you taste.
• Gemini prompt: “Guide me through a calming breath and grounding script I can record on my phone.”

2. HEALTHY DISTRACTION STRATEGIES
────────────────────────────
• “Reset in Motion”: pick a short walk route (5–10 minutes) and count teal or blue items you notice.
• Creative break: doodle, write lyrics, or voice memo how you feel for 5 minutes—delete if you want, the point is expression.
• Recovery content binge: queue inspiring talks or podcasts before stress hits to avoid doom-scrolling.
• Gemini prompt: “List five healthy distraction ideas I can use when cravings hit late at night.”

3. SLEEP HYGIENE & NIGHT ROUTINES
────────────────────────────
• Power down screens 45 minutes before bed; switch to warm lighting if possible.
• Create a wind-down sequence: herbal tea, stretch, journal.
• “Mind dump” page: write down worries, solutions, and a gratitude to release mental noise.
• Gemini prompt: “Help me design a calming 30-minute evening routine that keeps me off my phone.”

4. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH
────────────────────────────
• Movement menu: choose at least one option daily (walk, light jog, yoga flow, bodyweight circuit, dance break).
• Use the “Start with 5” rule—commit to five minutes; once you begin, decide whether to continue.
• Track post-movement mood using a 1–5 scale to learn what works best.
• Gemini prompt: “Create a 15-minute bodyweight routine requiring no equipment for small spaces.”

5. CRISIS CALM PLAN
────────────────────────────
• Identify your top three warning signs of overwhelm.
• List three people you can contact immediately (include phone numbers).
• Prepare a “comfort kit”: headphones, calming playlist, grounding object, affirmation cards.
• Include emergency numbers:
  - 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (USA)
  - 911 or local emergency services for immediate danger
  - https://www.988lifeline.org/ for chat/text options
• Gemini prompt: “Help me write a crisis plan template that includes warning signs, coping tools, and support contacts.”

REMEMBER: Pair these tools with professional care. Share the plan with your healthcare or counseling team for guidance.
