Channel lived experience into meaningful direction.

1. VALUES CLARIFICATION SPRINT
────────────────────────────
• List 10 moments that made you feel alive (not just “happy”).
• Circle the emotions or values that show up repeatedly (e.g., service, honesty, freedom).
• Narrow to your top 5 values and define what each means in one sentence.
• Gemini prompt: “Help me define my top five values using short, powerful statements rooted in service and recovery.”

────────────────────────────
2. PASSION-TO-PURPOSE BRIDGE
────────────────────────────
• Create two columns:
  - Column A: Skills or interests you enjoy (storytelling, cooking, peer support).
  - Column B: Community needs you’ve witnessed (overdose education, pet safety, resource navigation).
• Draw lines connecting any skill that could meet a need.
• Choose one connection to experiment with in the next 7 days.
• Gemini prompt: “Generate three micro-project ideas combining [skill] and [community need] to test this week.”

────────────────────────────
3. MEANINGFUL GOAL SETTING MAP
────────────────────────────
• Define a 90-day “Impact Target” (example: “Support 10 people in accessing harm reduction tools”).
• Break it down using the M.A.P. method:
  - Milestones (monthly checkpoints)
  - Actions (weekly tasks)
  - Partners (who can help)
• Gemini prompt: “Turn my impact target into a 90-day roadmap with milestones, actions, and accountability partners.”

4. SERVICE-ORIENTED THINKING PRACTICES
────────────────────────────
• Weekly “Service Scan”: Ask “Who around me could use a message, resource, or ride?”
• Gratitude-to-Action formula: Thank someone, then ask how you can support their week.
• Story bank: Keep a note of meaningful interactions so you can share them (with consent) when inspiring others.
• Gemini prompt: “Draft a kind outreach message offering support to someone new in recovery without sounding pushy.”

5. PURPOSE REVIEW & EVOLUTION
────────────────────────────
• Monthly reflection questions:
  1. What actions this month aligned with my core values?
  2. Where did I feel drained or off-mission?
  3. Which relationships fueled my purpose?
• Update your Impact Target based on insights.
• Share your reflections with a mentor or accountability partner for feedback.
• Gemini prompt: “Summarize my monthly purpose reflections in a motivating paragraph I can share with my support team.”

Use this framework with mentors, therapists, or coaches to ensure your purpose supports your recovery.
