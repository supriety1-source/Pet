Design mornings that keep recovery anchored and purpose-driven.

1. WAKE-UP STABILITY PROTOCOL (20 MINUTES)
────────────────────────────
• Minute 0–2: Hydrate with 8–12 oz of water; note one word describing how you feel.
• Minute 2–5: Stretch spine, hips, and shoulders (cat-cow, forward fold, shoulder rolls).
• Minute 5–10: Light exposure (window or outdoor walk) while repeating a grounding affirmation.
• Minute 10–20: “Anchor Focus” session – review top 3 commitments for the day.
• Gemini prompt: “Create a motivational audio script for my morning anchor focus using Joey Noble’s tone.”

2. HABIT STACKING FRAMEWORK
────────────────────────────
• Choose one core anchor (e.g., morning tea, coffee, or vitamins).
• Attach a micro-action before and after the anchor:
  - BEFORE anchor → two-minute breath cycle (inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6).
  - AFTER anchor → write one sentence in a mindset log (“Today I fight for…”).
• Weekly add-on: introduce one new positive micro-action once the stack feels automatic.
• Gemini prompt: “Suggest three habit stacks that fit a 15-minute morning routine focused on sobriety and service.”

3. PROGRESS TRACKING SYSTEMS
────────────────────────────
• Momentum grid (printable or digital): columns for Date, Mood (1–5), Actions Completed, Ally Contacted.
• Weekly review questions:
  1. What actions guaranteed my best days?
  2. Which commitments felt heavy or misaligned?
  3. Who showed up for me that I can appreciate?
• Color code successes with mint (#34D399) to reinforce wins visually.
• Gemini prompt: “Build a simple spreadsheet layout with columns for mood, commitments, and gratitude shoutouts.”

4. MOTIVATION MAINTENANCE STRATEGIES
────────────────────────────
• “Two-minute wins”: when motivation dips, set a timer and complete any positive action (dishes, texting a supporter, journaling).
• Playlist strategy: build a 3-song set that runs ~10 minutes. Use it to transition from inertia to action.
• Future-cast letters: write a note from your future self describing how discipline protected your life.
• Gemini prompt: “Write a 150-word letter from my future self celebrating 90 days of consistent morning routines.”

5. WEEKLY RESET RITUAL (SUNDAYS OR YOUR DAY OFF)
────────────────────────────
• Review tracking grid; highlight three proudest moments.
• Identify one habit to upgrade (e.g., extend meditation from 3 to 5 minutes).
• Plan one community action (call a mentor, share a resource, schedule a meeting).
• Set a “non-negotiable” statement and post it where you prep in the morning.
• Gemini prompt: “Draft a Sunday reset checklist with reminders to celebrate progress and plan next week’s anchor commitments.”

Remember: Share this blueprint with your professional support team to tailor it safely to your needs.
