Lead, mentor, and amplify recovery communities with integrity.
Created by Joey Noble · Educational leadership resource.

1. ADVANCED PEER SUPPORT STRATEGIES
────────────────────────────
• Create a support rotation: pair newcomers with rotating “buddies” for weekly check-ins.
• Use the “Listen-Reflect-Resource” model:
  1. Listen without interrupting.
  2. Reflect what you heard (“It sounds like…”).
  3. Offer one resource or question (“Would it help to review the Bernese Method guide together?”).
• Gemini prompt: “Draft a facilitation script for a 30-minute peer support circle focused on harm reduction wins.”

2. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PATHWAY
────────────────────────────
• Stage 1 – Observer: attend meetings, note what works, and offer to help with setup or clean-up.
• Stage 2 – Co-Facilitator: lead opening check-ins, share personal wins, and manage time respectfully.
• Stage 3 – Mentor Leader: host topic nights, coordinate resources, and mentor new facilitators.
• Leadership reflection questions:
  - What tone did I set?
  - Did everyone feel seen?
  - What follow-ups do I owe?
• Gemini prompt: “Provide five reflective questions for debriefing after leading a recovery group.”

3. MENTOR / MENTEE RELATIONSHIP BLUEPRINT
────────────────────────────
• Set expectations early:
  - Frequency of check-ins (weekly, bi-weekly).
  - Communication method (call, text, encrypted chat).
  - Topics that are off-limits or require professional referral.
• “The 5 C’s” of mentorship: Consistency, Confidentiality, Compassion, Challenge, Celebration.
• Feedback loop: once a month, both parties share one thing to improve.
• Gemini prompt: “Create a mentor-mentee agreement outline for recovery partnerships.”

4. PUBLIC SPEAKING & STORY SHARING (ETHICAL GUIDELINES)
────────────────────────────
• Story arc template:
  1. Hook – the moment everything changed.
  2. Struggle – the honest challenges (without glamorizing use).
  3. Solution – the resources that worked (directory, mindset, community).
  4. Invitation – how listeners can access help now.
• Safeguard details: avoid sharing other people’s stories without consent and never mention active legal matters.
• Prep checklist before speaking:
  - Confirm event purpose and audience age range.
  - Prepare a resource handout or QR code linking to Supriety™️ guides.
  - Identify emotional support for after your talk.
• Gemini prompt: “Write a 3-minute talk outline sharing my recovery journey responsibly and offering the Supriety™️ directory.”

5. DIGITAL AMPLIFICATION & COLLABORATIONS
────────────────────────────
• Create a monthly content theme (e.g., “Pet Safety Month,” “Narcan Awareness Week”).
• Batch create assets with Gemini: ask for captions, scripts, or email drafts using prompts inside this guide.
• Collaboration outreach template:
  - Compliment their mission.
  - Share how Supriety™️ resources align.
  - Suggest a co-created live, workshop, or resource swap.
• Gemini prompt: “Draft a collaboration email inviting a local nonprofit to co-host a Naloxone awareness livestream.”

Lead with empathy, protect confidentiality, and always refer medical questions to licensed professionals.
