SUPRIETY™️ FUNNEL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
Built by Joey Noble’s lived experience – now it’s your turn to launch.

BEFORE YOU START
• Gather your hosting credentials (GoDaddy, Netlify, etc.).
• Create or log into your PayHip account.
• Choose your email service provider (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Beehiiv, etc.).

STEP 1 – CONVERT TEXT FILES TO PDF
1. Open each .txt file inside WEB_FILES/free-downloads/ and PAYHIP_PRODUCTS/.
2. Paste the content into Google Docs or Microsoft Word.
3. Format with clear headings, bullet lists, and the Supriety™️ color palette (teal, ocean blue, mint).
4. Export each document as PDF, keeping the same filename (only change the extension to .pdf).
5. Store the PDFs locally for uploading in later steps.

STEP 2 – PREPARE WEB FILES FOR HOSTING
1. Upload everything inside SUPRIETY_FUNNEL_COMPLETE/WEB_FILES/ to your hosting root directory.
2. Ensure index.html is at the root so it becomes the main landing page.
3. Confirm thankyou.html is accessible directly (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/thankyou.html).
4. Upload the free-download .txt files (and PDFs if you want to host them) into a folder named free-downloads/ on the server.
5. If you prefer serving PDFs, update the download links in index.html and thankyou.html accordingly.

STEP 3 – CONNECT YOUR EMAIL CAPTURE
1. In your ESP, create a list/audience specifically for Supriety™️ leads.
2. Generate the HTML embed form from your ESP.
3. Replace the entire &lt;form&gt; in index.html (id="lead-form") with the embed code.
4. Keep the countdown and surrounding copy intact for maximum conversion.
5. Submit a test entry to ensure the form captures emails and reroutes to thankyou.html (set the redirect inside your ESP).

STEP 4 – LAUNCH PRODUCTS ON PAYHIP
1. Upload each PDF from PAYHIP_PRODUCTS/ to PayHip as an individual product.
2. Set pricing to pay-what-you-want with a default of $8.97 and add tier suggestions ($20, $40, $60).
3. Add the 14-day money-back guarantee to your PayHip product description.
4. Copy the final PayHip product link.
5. In index.html and thankyou.html, update the data-payhip-base attribute (search for "data-payhip-base") and the fallback href links with your actual PayHip URL.

STEP 5 – UPDATE SLIDER DOWNLOAD LINKS (OPTIONAL PDF SWAP)
1. If you uploaded PDFs, edit the href attributes for the three free download buttons in thankyou.html and index.html to point to the PDFs.
2. Keep the slider arrows as-is; the JavaScript already enables next/previous navigation.
3. Test each arrow button to confirm smooth transitions on mobile and desktop.

STEP 6 – VERIFY COUNTDOWN & PAY-WHAT-YOU-WANT
1. Open index.html in a browser to confirm the 3-day countdown starts.
2. Change the pay-what-you-want options to ensure the button text and donation note update.
3. Repeat the test on thankyou.html. The same script powers both pages.
4. Clear localStorage in your browser if you want to reset the countdown during testing.

STEP 7 – FINAL TEST PASS
1. Visit the landing page on mobile and desktop devices.
2. Submit your email to trigger the redirect to thankyou.html.
3. Click each free download button and slider arrow.
4. Click the toolkit CTA to confirm it routes to PayHip with the amount parameter appended.
5. Review disclaimers and money-back guarantee text for accuracy.
6. Share the funnel with a trusted ally for feedback before public launch.

MAINTENANCE NOTES
• Update external resource links quarterly to ensure accuracy.
• Rotate Gemini prompts or add new ones as your story evolves.
• Celebrate big contributors publicly (with permission) via your email list or social channels.
• Keep analytics from your ESP and PayHip to track conversion improvements.
